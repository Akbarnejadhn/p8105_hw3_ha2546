# Problem1

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?
I grouped the dtaset by the aisles, and understood that there are total of 134 different isles. Then I counted the number of times items have been ordered from each isle. By further arranging this column in descending order, I found the most popular isles. Top five aisles with the most items ordered from are fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged vegetable fruits, yogurt, packaged cheese.


```{r instacart}

library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

aisle_fav_n = instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(aisle, name = "aisle_order_n") %>% 
  arrange(desc(aisle_order_n))

aisle_fav_n
```

```{r}
